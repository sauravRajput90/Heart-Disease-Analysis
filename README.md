# Heart Disease Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF THE TASK
Cardiovascular Health Prediction is a data-driven project aimed at developing a predictive model to assess an individual's risk of developing heart disease based on various health indicators. By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing relevant medical data, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into cardiovascular health and enable early intervention and prevention strategies.


### Project Goal:  
* To identify key factors contributing to heart disease occurrence.  
* To predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators.  
* To provide insights for early diagnosis and prevention.


## Key Tasks:  

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning:  
* Gather a relevant dataset containing information about individuals, their health conditions, and whether they have heart disease.  
* Clean the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
* Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and visualize potential patterns.  
* Look for relationships between health indicators and heart disease occurrence.

### Feature Engineering: 
* Create new features or transform existing ones to improve predictive power.
* Consider feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features.

## Question Formulation:  
* HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEART DISEASE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE DOSEN'T HAVE HEART DISEASE ?  
* people of which sex has most heart disease ?  
* people of which sex has which type of chest pain most ?  
* people with which chest pain are most pron to have heart disease ?  
* How does the number of major vessels (ca) affect the likelihood of heart disease?  
* What is the distribution of age among patients with and without heart disease?  
* Is there a difference in the distribution of cholesterol levels between males and females?  
* What is the correlation between age and resting blood pressure (trestbps)?
