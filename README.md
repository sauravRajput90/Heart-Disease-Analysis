# project -Understanding the Heart Disease Analysis Project

## OVERVIEW OF THE TASK

### Project Goal:  
* To identify key factors contributing to heart disease occurrence.  
* To predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators.  
* To provide insights for early diagnosis and prevention.


## Key Tasks:  

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning:  
* Gather a relevant dataset containing information about individuals, their health conditions, and whether they have heart disease.  
* Clean the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
* Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and visualize potential patterns.  
* Look for relationships between health indicators and heart disease occurrence.

### Feature Engineering: 
* Create new features or transform existing ones to improve predictive power.
* Consider feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features.

## Question Formulation:  
* HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEART DISEASE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE DOSEN'T HAVE HEART DISEASE ?  
* people of which sex has most heart disease ?  
* people of which sex has which type of chest pain most ?  
* people with which chest pain are most pron to have heart disease ?  
* How does the number of major vessels (ca) affect the likelihood of heart disease?  
* What is the distribution of age among patients with and without heart disease?  
* Is there a difference in the distribution of cholesterol levels between males and females?  
* What is the correlation between age and resting blood pressure (trestbps)?
